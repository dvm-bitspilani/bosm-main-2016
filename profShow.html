      Young, energetic, full of surprises and utter madness on stage,
      Lagori has, over the last 4 years, brought thousands to their
      feet at their concerts. This Bangalore based band comprises 5
      unique musicians, one crazier than the other, bringing their own
      flavours and styles to the table.<br><br>
      Combining Rock, Funk, Pop and Indian Classical inflections
      Lagori creates a sound that is rich, young, hip, honest and
      completely infectious! Pronounced ‘La-go-ree’, the band gets
      its name from the popular street game played in South India.
      The band is fascinated by the rich diversity of culture that
      exists in our country - especially the evolving definition of
      what it means to be Indian.<br><br>
      Music which seeps down your heart, gives you goosebumps and makes you discover something which is more than you. Melodies which are relatable, which touch the softest unexplored corners of your heart and which take you to a world away from the real, deep into your fantasies. Get ready to experience Lagori.
      We dare you to try not to dance along!
