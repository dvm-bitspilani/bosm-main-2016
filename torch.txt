The Greeks considered fire to be a divine element, and they maintained perpetual fires in front of their principal temples at Olympia during the Ancient Games. 

Like the messengers that proclaimed the sacred Olympic Truce, the student torchbearers of BITS Pilani carry the BOSM Torch and a message of peace on their journey. 

The flame is an important symbol of BOSM, symbolic for Peace, Unity and Friendship.
