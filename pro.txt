Young, energetic, full of surprises and utter madness on stage, Lagori has, over the last 4 years, brought thousands to their feet at their concerts. This Bangalore based band comprises 5 unique musicians, one crazier than the other, bringing their own flavours and styles to the table. 


Combining Rock, Funk, Pop and Indian Classical inflections Lagori creates a sound that is rich, young, hip, honest and completely infectious! Pronounced ‘La-go-ree’, the band gets its name from the popular street game played in South India. The band is fascinated by the rich diversity of culture that exists in our country - especially the evolving definition of what it means to be Indian.


Music which seeps down your heart, gives you goosebumps and makes you discover something which is more than you. Melodies which are relatable, which touch the softest unexplored corners of your heart and which take you to a world away from the real, deep into your fantasies. Get ready to experience Lagori.


We dare you to try not to dance along!
