        The Greeks considered fire to be a divine element, and they maintained perpetual fires in front of their principal temples at Olympia during the Ancient Games.<br/><br/>
        Like the messengers that proclaimed the sacred Olympic Truce, the student torchbearers of <strong>BITS Pilani</strong> carry the <strong>BOSM Torch</strong> and a message of peace on their journey.<br/><br/>
        The flame is an important symbol of <strong>BOSM</strong>, symbolic for Peace, Unity and Friendship.
